# 📱 API Versioning Strategy

To ensure backward compatibility and smooth upgrades, RiderX APIs will follow a strict versioning policy.

---

## 🔢 Versioning Approach

- Use URI path versioning: `/api/v1/...`
- New major versions increment `vN` (e.g., `v2`)
- Minor or patch changes are backward-compatible and don’t increment version number

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

- Separate controllers or router groups per version
- Maintain older versions for at least 6 months after new major release
- Deprecation warnings in response headers and docs

---

## 🔍 Documentation

- Version-specific Swagger docs available at `/api/v1/docs`, `/api/v2/docs`
- Clear migration guides for breaking changes

---

## 🚀 Deployment

- Version routing handled by API Gateway or backend routing layer
- Load balancer or reverse proxy routes requests to appropriate service version

---

## ⚠️ Best Practices

- Avoid breaking changes unless absolutely necessary
- Keep endpoints consistent and stable
- Deprecate old APIs with clear timelines
