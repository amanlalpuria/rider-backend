# 🚀 Deployment and CI/CD Strategy

This document outlines the processes and tools for deploying RiderX backend and frontend components safely and efficiently.

---

## 🛠️ CI/CD Pipeline

- **Tools**: GitHub Actions / Jenkins / GitLab CI
- Steps:
    1. Code linting and formatting checks
    2. Unit and integration test execution
    3. Build Docker images
    4. Push images to container registry (e.g., AWS ECR, Docker Hub)
    5. Deploy to staging environment automatically
    6. Manual approval for production deployment

---

## 🌍 Environments

- **Development**: Local machines and dev environment
- **Staging**: Mirror of production for QA/testing
- **Production**: Live environment serving users

---

## 🧰 Deployment Targets

- Backend services on Kubernetes clusters or ECS
- Frontend on CDN (e.g., AWS CloudFront, Netlify)
- Database migrations automated via Flyway or Liquibase

---

## 🔄 Rollbacks and Blue-Green Deployment

- Use blue-green or canary deployments to minimize downtime
- Automated rollback triggers on failed health checks

---

## 🔐 Secrets Management

- Use HashiCorp Vault or cloud provider secret managers
- Never hardcode secrets or API keys in repos

---

## 📄 Documentation

- Maintain deployment runbooks and incident response guides
- Automated deployment logs and audit trails
