# 🔐 Security Best Practices

Security is critical for a platform handling real-time rides, payments, and identity. This document summarizes practices across backend, frontend, and infrastructure.

---

## 🔒 Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based token authentication with expiry & refresh token
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all routes
- Admin-only actions gated with scopes

---

## 🧾 Data Validation

- DTOs + Bean Validation in Spring Boot
- Strict type checking in API payloads
- Global error handler for structured responses

---

## 💳 Payment Safety

- PCI-compliant payment gateway (Razorpay, Stripe)
- Webhook verification and replay protection
- Amount calculation on server, not client

---

## 🛡️ API & Network Security

- HTTPS enforced everywhere
- Rate limiting via API Gateway (or Nginx)
- Input sanitization to prevent XSS, SQLi

---

## 🔐 Secrets & Config

- No secrets in Git tracked files
- Use `.env`, AWS Parameter Store or Vault
- GitHub Secrets for CI/CD workflows

---

## 📋 Auditing & Monitoring

- Admin actions are logged (IP, time, action)
- CloudWatch + Sentry/LogRocket for incident reporting
- Alerting on failed payments, suspicious login attempts

---

## ✅ Compliance & Legal

- GDPR-like consent and privacy policy
- Opt-in for notifications
- Ability to export or delete user account

---

## 🔄 Regular Practices

- Dependency updates with Renovatebot
- Security scans (e.g., Trivy, OWASP ZAP)
- Manual penetration testing for major releases
