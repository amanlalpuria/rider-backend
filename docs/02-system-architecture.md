# 🏗️ System Architecture

## Overview

RiderX is a scalable, modular, service-oriented architecture that supports multiple ride types (car, bike, carpool) and real-time operations across mobile and backend infrastructure.

## 🔧 High-Level Architecture Diagram

**Components:**
- Mobile App (React Native)
- API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway or NGINX)
- Backend Services (Spring Boot microservices)
- Database Layer (PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB)
- Message Queue (RabbitMQ / Kafka)
- Cloud Infrastructure (AWS: EC2, RDS, S3, etc.)

```
[Mobile App] ---> [API Gateway] ---> [Auth Service]
                                     [User Service]
                                     [Driver Service]
                                     [Ride Booking Service]
                                     [Payment Service]
                                     [Notification Service]
                                     [Analytics Service]
```

Each service communicates with a database or cache (PostgreSQL / Redis) and publishes events to Kafka/RabbitMQ.

## 📱 Client Layer
- React Native for cross-platform apps (iOS & Android)
- Real-time updates via WebSocket or MQTT

## 🌐 API Gateway
- Centralized entry point with SSL, JWT auth, rate limiting

## 🧩 Microservices
Each service is built with Spring Boot, communicates via REST or async events.

## 🗄️ Database Layer
- PostgreSQL (RDS)
- Redis (session, ride status)
- MongoDB (optional)
- Elasticsearch (optional search)

## 📦 Message Queue
- Kafka or RabbitMQ for async event flow

## ☁️ Deployment
- Docker + Kubernetes (EKS) or Compose (MVP)
- Hosted on AWS with auto-scaling, monitoring, CI/CD

## 🔒 Security
- OAuth2 + JWT
- Role-based access
- HTTPS, firewall, secrets management

## ⚙️ Fault Tolerance
- Circuit breakers, retries, load balancing
